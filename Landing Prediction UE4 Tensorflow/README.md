# UE4 Game Environment with tensorflow integration for ML Testing

Environment for testing ANN model that takes in player data and updates world parameters accordingly.

This is a basic UE4 Environment that utilizes a neural network by taking in player behaviour data from Unreal Engine as an input and outputs environmental parameter updates which are applied in-game. The neural network model has been integrated with a simple game that takes in a player's location and velocity at the point of jumping and predicts where they will land. This prediction is used to spawn a block at the predicted landing point to catch the player.
